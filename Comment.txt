File : Db_connection.php

- Connect/Create database

##########################

* Table (users) and DB (catalyst_task) creation does not require to create externally. It will create automatically when the file user_upload.php has been executed. *

I have included below logic as per your assumptions:

- table name as per document is "users" and field names are name, surname, email.
- one extra field added in table userID it's auto increment and primary key.
- email address is unique in this table.
- Invalid email address record doesn't included in DB.
- user name and surname field all converted to Proper case.
- email address field is in all letter is make a small.
- try catch used for error handling.
